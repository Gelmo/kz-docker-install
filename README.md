# kz-docker-install

This is the base-install image for working with GOKZ and KZTimer in Docker. This is not the image you should be building from. There will be another image in use for the server, from which endusers and devs will be pulling. This image/repo should only need to be updated when there are updates to GOKZ and/or KZTimer. Documentation for doing so will be written up soon.
